This is the final project repository for all the code that will be in the presentation

This Code is being used for TMT and it was designed for the use in bulletein boards.  It takes the xml format of the website/
database and uses BeautifulSoup4 to parse the information.  It then uses a module openpyxl to create a excel workbook that can report 
the data and will have links to the website.

You will need to download the following packages:
-datetime
-requests
-BeautifulSoup4
-openpyxl
